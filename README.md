# Real-Life Anomaly Detection in Industrial Applications  

## Research Internship (January 2025 - April 2025)  
**Deakin University**  

### Overview  
This project focuses on evaluating and improving the **Empirical Cumulative Outlier Detection (ECOD)** algorithm for real-world anomaly detection in industrial applications. The study includes rigorous empirical analysis of ECOD variants across multiple statistical distributions and benchmark datasets.  

### Key Contributions  
- **Empirical Evaluation:** Assessed different ECOD algorithm variants to analyze their effectiveness.  
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Designed and tested modified ECOD architectures (**ECOD_L, ECOD_R, ECOD_CUSTOM**) against baseline models.  
- **Benchmarking:** Conducted experiments on six datasets: `cardio`, `ionosphere`, `mammography`, `satimage-2`, `statlog`, and `pima`.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated efficiency using:  
  - ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall curves  
  - Error analysis (false positive/negative characterization)
